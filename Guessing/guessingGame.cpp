using namespace std;

int main()
{

  // Create variable that will have a random number, variable to keep count, and
  // variable to store user's guess
  
  
  // Create loop that will keep asking user to guess until he actually guesses 
  // the correct answer or until the user runs out of tries. If the user doesn't
  // guess correctly, let user know if he needs to go higher or lower.
