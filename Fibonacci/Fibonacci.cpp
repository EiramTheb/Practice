DESCRIPTION: One of the classic beginner's practice problems. In the Fibonacci 
sequence of numbers, each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. Fibonacci 
began the sequence not with 0, 1, 1, 2, as modern mathematicians do but with 1,1, 2,
etc. He carried the calculation up to the thirteenth place (fourteenth in modern 
counting), that is 233, though another manuscript carries it to the next place: 1, 1,
2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377.
In this exercise, we want the user to input a number, and the program will calculate
the result until that number of iterations. For example, if the user inputs 3, the 
program will calculate 0+1=1, 1+1=2, 2+1=3, and then return 3, as 3 is the result of 
the 3rd iteration.
